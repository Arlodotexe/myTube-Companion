# Contributing
 Feel free to contribute to the project. There is currently no way to sync changes between versions of extension for Edge, Firefox and Chromium, meaning any changes you make to one will have to be make to the others manually. There are small API differences between the three (such as using callbacks over promises, and the `chrome` namespace versus the standard `browser` namespace) that make this nessecary for the time being. 
 
 If you open an issue, make sure to label it appropriately (`feature-request`, `bug`, etc)
