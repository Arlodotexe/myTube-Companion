# Contributing
 Feel free to contribute to the project. There is currently no way to sync changes between versions of extension for Edge, Firefox and Chromium, meaning any changes you make to one will have to be make to the others manually. I am testing out some ways to make the code for all 3 cross compatible, and the only thing currently stopping me is the manifest files all having subtly different requirements. Other than that, everything should be identical between all 3 `src` folders (even if Firefox isn't exactly to spec anymore - if this becomes an issue for functionality, I will fix it)
 
 If you open an issue, make sure to label it appropriately (`feature-request`, `bug`, etc)
