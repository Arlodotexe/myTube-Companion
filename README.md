# Installing

It's recommended that you install from the Web store corresponding to your browser:

 - Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mytube-companion/
 - Chrome/Opera: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mytube-companion/cgapamkaldokecljkpcfcchlpclmokmc
 
 
 ## Microsoft Edge
 
Currently, myTube! Companion is awaiting approval from Microsoft to be published to the Microsoft Store. In the meantime, you can [sideload](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-non-store-extensions-microsoft-edge) the the '`/edge/src`' folder to get the extension for Edge. 

NOTE: The .appx package is not signed and I cannot sign it myself due to technical difficulties. If you try to install it, it will fail.
